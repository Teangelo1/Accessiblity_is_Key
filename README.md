**Changes that were made to the existing code**

* Added a id to allow the search-engine-optimization link to function properly and direct users to the correct area after a single click. All links are currently function properly now.
&nbsp;
 
 * Implemented semantic structure into the HTML file. This task was done by replacing div's & classes with elements such as: section,article,aside,figure and summary to follow semantic structure and allow the code to be clean & easy to read. The reason for this change was to increase the readability for anyone who will be using a screen reader when viewing the webpage.
&nbsp;

* Updated CSS sheet to correspond with changes made to HTML sheet.
&nbsp;

* Organized CSS sheet to follow semantic structure and Added comments into the CSS file to explain the areas of the code .
&nbsp;

* Added accessible alt altributes. Implementing alt attributes will display a description of the image, If the image does not properly load.
